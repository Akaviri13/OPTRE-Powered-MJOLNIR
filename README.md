OPTRE Powered MJOLNIR

This mod does NOT add any equipment!

This mod adds energy shields, the ability to jump and hud overlay textures to the MJOLNIR from Operation Trebuchet, First Contact and Project MJOLNIR!
Every feature can be individually disabled so you can customize this mod to your needs.
While being designed for use with Operation Trebuchet this mod does not require it to function.

The shields now also work on AI!
Players activate the suit with the "Activate Suit" scroll wheel option.

Please report all issues you enounter so I can work on fixing them!

You can turn off the crosshair in the settings!

Current Features:
-Functional energy shield with the classic recharging sound effect.
-Energy shields on AI that wear the suit.
-A shield energy bar to let you know how much energy you have left.
-Particle effects when getting hit and when the shield is depleted.
-Different shield depletion rates for different weapons.
-The ability to jump, height and distance controlled by the angle of your camera.
-Increased Speed when wearing the armor.
-Recoil Suppression when wearing the armor.
-Fall damage prevention when wearing the armor.
-Custom HUD textures for every MJOLNIR helmet in Operation Trebuchet.
-Custom HUD textures for Sangheili Helmets.

Add your own equipment!

You can make whatever piece of equipment you want to work with this mod.
All you have to do is add the classnames of the equipment to the list in this mods addon settings seperated by commas.

The final resulting list should look something like this:
classname_1,classname_2,classname_3,classname_4

You can find all settings under "OPTRE Powered MJOLNIR" in the addon options.

Default Jump Key: Ctrl + Space


Planned Features:
-Armor abilities like cloaking, armor lock etc.
-More HUD features like rangefinder, gps etc.
-Improve particle effects.
-Make shield bar scale with UI Scale automatically.


If your shield bar looks weird go to the addon settings and try the other sizes!


Known Issues:
-If you jump while something is above you, you can get stuck to the roof. Going prone fixes it most of the time.
-Shield particle effects occasionally appear behind or inside the player making it look like they aren't there.
-Sparks are blue.
-Sometimes the same bullet hits you multiple times, depleting shield energy every time, for example if it goes through your arm and hits your torso after.
-You have to re-equip the helmet if you change hud settings for them to apply.
-Shield bar doesn't scale with resolution ratio. Only looks right on 16:9.
-HUD overlay is visible when looking down a scope or using optics in a vehicle.
-Elites/Sangheili are currently invulnerable to explosive damage if you use the normal version of Operation Trebuchet: First Contact. This is a bug in First Contact and it has been fixed in the [DEV] version of that mod.


FAQ:
Q: Does this work with ace?
A: Yes it does.

Q: Why is my character T-Posing when I use the MJOLNIR?
A: Its because you are trying to use the armor while not being a spartan which doesn't work. Spartans use a different animation skeleton. Sidenote: This mod doesn't add any equipment. The armor is from Operation Trebuchet.

Q: Does this have to run on clients or the only on the server?
A: This has to run everywhere, on the clients, the server, the headless clients if you have any. Everywhere.


Disclaimer:
Don't look at the scripts if you know coding or you will get a headache, you have been warned.
I probably didn't do things the most efficent way and although I haven't experienced this in my testing there could be a performance impact, especially with multiple people using this at once.
